>By clicking on the View todos, the tool opens


## **Descrition of the Tool with the "L" look**

>As soon as you are on the application side, you can already operate the Workload Manager. You create a ticket and press Add Todo. The default status of the ticket always remains Open, as long as you do not change the status in the table on the Update button. From then on, you can update the status to "inProgress" if you are working on it, or to "Done" if the work is done. The ID No. 1 always remains as an example that shows how the ticket will look like.
